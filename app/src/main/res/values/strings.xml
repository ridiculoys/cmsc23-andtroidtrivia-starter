        Lights Out is a puzzle game that consists of a 4 by 4 grid of lights.
        When the game starts, all lights are switched on.
        Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the four adjacent lights.
        The goal of the puzzle is to switch all the lights off with 5 or less clicks.
        Otherwise, it\'s game over.\n\n

        The author of this game is Louise Gabrielle Talip, a 19-year old BS Computer Science student
        of the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os. This is the fifth exercise to be submitted
        for the CMSC 23 Mobile Computing course where the students have to use Fragments and Data Binding
        in their Android app.

        The goal of the game is to "turn off" all the lights in the grid.
        To turn off a light, a player must click on the square tile.
        However, once clicked, the 4 adjacent tiles next to it (ABOVE, BELOW, LEFT, and RIGHT)
        will also be toggled off if it is not already off.\n\n
        When a light that has already been turned off is clicked, it will turn on again. It will also
        toggle the 4 adjacent tiles next to it. If the adjacent light is currently off, it will turn on.
        If it is currently on, it will turn off.\n\n
        In order to win the game, the player must find a way to turn off all lights with only 5 clicks or less.\n\n\n
        Happy clicking!
